fast-reader
===========

A small command line tool that implements the fast reading trick from http://learn2spritz.com/

Ever wondered wether you can read neuromancer at ~700 words per minute?

```
wget "https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9023376/raw/b69b8fe3f39ebef46ca79a4bf767060a63ff6ce1/neuromancer" -O -  | ruby fastread.rb
```

There you go!
